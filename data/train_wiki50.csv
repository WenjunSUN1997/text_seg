0,0,"[',1,preface.', 'Under feudalism in England during the mediaeval era, tenure by serjeanty was a form of tenure in return for some specified non-standard service, thus distinguishing it from knight-service.', 'It is also used of similar forms in Continental Europe.', ',2,Etymology.', 'The word comes from the French noun ""sergent"", itself from the Latin ""serviens, servientis"", ""serving"", the present participle of the verb ""servo"", ""to keep, preserve, save, rescue, deliver"".', '""Sergeant"" is derived from the same source, though developing an entirely different meaning.', ',2,Origins and development.', 'Serjeanty originated in the assignation of an estate in land on condition of the performance of a certain duty other than knight-service, usually the discharge of duties in the household of the king or a noble.', ""It ranged from non-standard service in the king's army (distinguished only by equipment from that of the knight), to petty renders (for example the rendering of a quantity of basic food such as a goose) scarcely distinguishable from those of the rent-paying tenant or socager."", 'The legal historians Pollock and Maitland (1895) described it as being a free ""servantship"" in the sense that the serjeant, whatever his task, was essentially a menial servant.', 'However the feudal historian Round objected that their definition does not cover military serjeanties and glosses over the honorific value of at least some of the services.', 'The historian Mary Bateson stated as follows concerning serjeanties:', '(They) were neither always military nor always agricultural, but might approach very closely the service of knights or the service of farmers ...', ""The serjeanty of holding the king's head when he made a rough passage across the Channel, of pulling a rope when his vessel landed, of counting his chessmen on Christmas day, of bringing fuel to his castle, of doing his carpentry, of finding his pot-herbs, of forging his irons for his ploughs, of tending his garden, of nursing the hounds gored and injured in the hunt, of serving as veterinary to his sick falcons, such and many others might be the ceremonial or menial services due from a given serjeanty."", 'The varieties of serjeanty were later increased by lawyers, who the sake of convenience categorised under this head such duties as escort service to the Abbess of Barking, or of military service on the Welsh border by the men of Archenfield.', ',3,Domesday Book.', 'Serjeants (""servientes"") already appear as a distinct class in the Domesday Book of 1086, though not in all cases differentiated from the barons, who held by knight-service.', ""A few mediaeval tenures by serjeanty can be definitely traced as far back as Domesday in the case of three Hampshire serjeanties: those of acting as king's marshal, of finding an archer for his service, and of keeping the gaol in Winchester Castle."", 'It is probable, however, that many supposed tenures by serjeanty were not really such, although so described in returns, in inquisitions post mortems, and other records.', 'The simplest legal test of the tenure was that serjeants, though liable to the feudal exactions of wardship, etc., were not liable to scutage; they made in place of this exaction special composition with the Crown.', 'Some of the Domesday Book tenants may have been serjeants before the Norman Conquest, in the time of King Edward the Confessor.', 'For instance, a certain Siward ""Accipitrarius"" (from Latin ""accipiter"", ""hawk""), presumably hawker to Edward the Confessor, held from the king an estate worth £7 in Somerset and did so in an area appropriate to his occupation, close to a water habitat.', 'J.H.', 'Round ascribed the development of serjeanties in England to Norman influence, though he did not dismiss earlier roots.', 'The Anglo-Saxon historian James Campbell has suggested that serjeanties such as the messenger services recorded in the 13th century may represent ""semi-fossilised remnants of important parts of the Anglo-Saxon governmental system"".', ',2,Grand serjeanty vs petty serjeanty.', 'The germ of the later distinction between ""grand"" (French: ""grand"", ""large"") and ""petty"" (French ""petit"", ""small"") serjeanty is found in the Magna Carta of 1215, the king there renouncing the right of prerogative wardship in the case of those who held of him by the render of small articles.', 'The legal doctrine which developed that serjeanties were inalienable (i.e.', 'non-transferrable) and impartible, led during the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272) to the arrentation of those serjeanties the lands of which had been partly alienated, which were thereby converted into socage tenures (i.e.', 'paying money rents), or in some cases, tenures by knight-service.', 'Gradually the gulf widened, and ""petty"" serjeanties, consisting of renders, together with serjeanties held of mesne lords, sank into socage, while ""grand"" serjeanties, the holders of which performed their service in person, became alone liable to the burden of wardship and marriage.', 'In Littleton\'s ""Tenures"" (15th century), this distinction appears as well defined, but the development was one of legal theory.', ',2,Disintegration.', 'By the reign of King Edward I (1272–1307), tenure by serjeanty was well on the retreat, as Kimball (1936) observes:', '""Once it began to give way, serjeanty disintegrated more quickly and easily than the other tenures as the feudal conception of society lost its hold...Its miscellaneous services had...many fates.', ""A large number soon became obsolete; others were commuted to money payments or changed to knight's service; a few that were honourable or ornamental were retained in their original form as part of the coronation ceremony."", 'Some being still useful were performed by deputy, or absorbed into the regular administrative system.', 'When the military tenure of knight-service was abolished at the Restoration of the Monarchy by King Charles II (1649–1651), that of grand serjeanty was retained, doubtless on account of its honorary character, it being then limited in practice to the performance of certain duties at coronations, the discharge of which as a right has always been coveted, and the earliest record of which is that of the coronation of Queen Eleanor of Provence in 1236.', ""The most conspicuous are those of Queen's Champion, appurtenant to the manor of Scrivelsby, long held by the Dymoke family, and of supporting the king's right arm, appurtenant to the manor of Worksop."", ',2,Modern remnants.', ""The duty of supporting the king's right arm was still performed at the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902."", ""The meaning of serjeant as a household officer is still preserved in the monarch's serjeants-at-arms, serjeant-surgeons and serjeant-trumpeter."", 'The horse and foot serjeants (""servientes"") of the king\'s army in the 12th century, who ranked after the knights and were more lightly armed, were unconnected with land tenure.', ',2,Hereditary offices in gross.', 'Serjeanty is to be distinguished from offices held hereditarily ""in gross"".', 'These are not serjeanties, as they were not incidents of the tenure of a manor or other land.', 'They are heritable in the same way as baronies by writ, so that they can pass to a daughter where there is no male heir, and be split between daughters as co-heiresses if there are several.', 'Examples include:']","[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1,

book was ""Black Beauty"", written between 1871 and 1877 in her house at Old Catton.', 'During this time, her health was declining, and she could barely get out of bed.', 'Her dearly-loved mother often had to help her in her illness.', 'She sold the book to the local publishers, Jarrold & Sons.', 'The book broke records for sales and is the “sixth best seller in the English language.""', ""By telling the story of a horse's life in the form of an autobiography and describing the world through the eyes of the horse, Anna Sewell broke new literary ground."", 'Sewell died of hepatitis or tuberculosis on 25 April 1878, only five months after the novel was published, but she lived long enough to see its initial success.', 'She was buried on 30 April 1878 in the Quaker burial-ground at Lammas near Buxton, Norfolk, where a wall plaque marks her resting place.', 'Her birthplace in Church Plain, Great Yarmouth, is now a museum.', 'Sewell did not write the novel for children.', 'She said that her purpose in writing the novel was ""to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses""—an influence she attributed to an essay on animals she read earlier by Horace Bushnell (1802–1876) entitled ""Essay on Animals"".', 'Her sympathetic portrayal of the plight of working animals led to a vast outpouring of concern for animal welfare and is said to have been instrumental in the abolition of the cruel practice of using the checkrein (or ""bearing rein"", a strap used to keep horses\' heads high, fashionable in Victorian England but painful and damaging to a horse\'s neck).', '""Black Beauty"" also mentions the use of blinkers on horses, concluding that this use is likely to cause accidents at night due to interference with ""the full use of"" a horse\'s ability to ""see much better in the dark than men can.""', ',2,Plot summary.', 'The story is narrated in the first person as an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named Black Beauty—beginning with his carefree days as a colt on an English farm with his mother, to his difficult life pulling cabs in London, to his happy retirement in the country.', 'Along the way, he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness.', ""Each short chapter recounts an incident in Black Beauty's life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment of horses, with Sewell's detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude."", 'The book describes conditions among London horse-drawn taxicab drivers, including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low, legally fixed fares.', 'A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day taxicab licences (not allowed to trade on Sundays) and 7-day taxicab licences (allowed to trade on Sundays) was abolished and the taxicab licence fee was much reduced.', ',2,Analysis.', 'Sewell uses anthropomorphism in ""Black Beauty"".', 'The text advocates fairer treatment of horses in Victorian England.', 'The story is narrated from Black Beauty\'s perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the ""bearing rein"" and ""blinkers"" as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses.', 'For instance, Ginger describes the physical effects of the ""bearing rein"" to Black Beauty, by stating, ""... it is dreadful... your neck aching until you don’t know how to bear it... its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips"".', ""Tess Coslett highlights that Black Beauty's story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves."", 'The horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics, like love and loyalty, which are similar to those of human beings.', 'Coslett emphasises that, while ""Black Beauty"" is not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography, it is a novel that ""allows the reader to slide in and out of horse-consciousness, blurring the human/animal divide"".', ',2,Reception.', 'Upon publication of the book, many readers related to the pain of the victimised horses, sympathised and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well-being of horses.', 'Two years after the release of the novel, one million copies of ""Black Beauty"" were in circulation in the United States.', 'In addition, animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables.', 'The depiction of the ""bearing rein"" in ""Black Beauty"" spurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in Victorian England, but public interest in anti-cruelty legislation in the United States also grew significantly.', 'The arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses in ""Black Beauty"" inspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals.', 'The impact of the novel is still very much recognised today.', 'Writing in the ""Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare"", Bernard Unti calls ""Black Beauty"" ""the most influential anticruelty novel of all time"".', 'Comparisons have also been made between ""Black Beauty"" and the most important social protest novel in the United States, ""Uncle Tom\'s Cabin"", by Harriet Beecher Stowe, on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society.', ',2,Theatrical adaptations.', '""Black Beauty"" was adapted for the stage in 2011 by playwright James Stone.', 'The play was perform at the Broughton Hall Estate, North Yorkshire and Epsom Racecourse, Surrey.', 'The production was a critical success and was performed around the UK in 2012.']","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

3,3,"[',1,preface.', 'The Lorenz beam was blind-landing radio navigation system developed by C. Lorenz AG in Berlin.', 'The first system had been installed in 1932 at Berlin-Tempelhof Central Airport, followed by Dübendorf in Switzerland (1934) and others all over the world.', 'The Lorenz company referred to it simply as the Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer, German for ""ultra-short-wave landing radio beacon"", or LFF.', 'Prior to the World War II the Germans had deployed the landing aid system at many Luftwaffe airfields in and outside Germany and equipped most of their bombers with the radio equipment needed to use it.', 'The RAF continued using the system as late as 1955, under the name Standard Beam Approach (SBA).', 'The basic idea behind the short-range LFF system was later developed into a long-range system for air navigation known as Elektra.', 'Further development produced a system that worked over very long distances, hundreds or thousands of kilometres, known as Sonne (or often, Elektra-Sonnen) that allowed aircraft and U-Boats to take fixes far into the Atlantic.', 'The British captured Sonne receivers and maps and started to use it for their own navigation under the name Consol.', ',2,Description.', 'The blind approach navigation system was developed starting in 1932 by Dr. Ernst Kramar of the Lorenz company.', 'It was adopted by Deutsche Lufthansa in 1934 and sold around the world.', 'The Lorenz company was founded in 1880 by Carl Lorenz and is now part of ITT.', 'Lorenz used a single radio transmitter at 33,33\xa0MHz (Anflugfunkfeuer) and three antennas placed in a line parallel to the end of the runway.', 'The center antenna was always powered, while the other two were short circuited by a mechanical rotary switch turned by a simple motor.', 'This resulted in a ""kidney"" shaped broadcast pattern centered on one of the two ""side"" antennas depending on which antenna had been short-circuited.', 'The contacts on the switch were set so that one antenna was shorted for the time to be considered a ""Dot"" by a morse operator and the other as a ""Dash"".', 'The signal could be detected for some distance off the end of the runway, as much as 30\xa0km.', 'The Lorenz obtained a sharper beam than could be created by an aerial array by having two lobes of signal.', 'A pilot approaching the runway would tune his radio to the broadcast frequency and listen for the signal.', 'If he heard a series of dots, he knew he was off the runway centerline to the left (the ""dot-sector"") and had to turn to the right to line up with the runway.', 'If he was to the right, he would hear a series of dashes instead (the ""dash-sector""), and turned left.', 'The key to the operation of the system was an area in the middle where the two signals overlapped.', 'The dots of the one signal ""filled in"" the dashes of the other, resulting in a steady tone known as the ""equi-signal"".', 'By adjusting his path until he heard the equi-signal, the pilot could align his aircraft with the runway for landing.', 'Two small marker beacons were also used: one 300\xa0m off the end of runway, the ""HEZ"" (Haupteinflugzeichen), and another 3\xa0km away, the ""VEZ"" (Voreinflugzeichen), both were broadcast on 38\xa0MHz and modulated at 1700 and 700\xa0Hz, respectively.', 'These signals were broadcast directly upward, and would be heard briefly as the aircraft flew over them.', 'To approach the runway, the pilot would fly to a published altitude and then use the main directional signals to line up with the runway and started flying toward it.', 'When he flew over the VEZ he would start descending on a standard glide slope, continuing to land or abort at the HEZ depending on whether or not he could see the runway.', 'Lorenz could fly a plane down a straight line with relatively high accuracy, enough so that the aircraft could then find the runway visually in all but the worst conditions.', 'However it required a fairly constant monitoring of the radio by the pilot, who would often also be tasked with talking to the local control tower.', 'In order to ease the workload, Lorenz later introduced a cockpit indicator that could listen to the signals and display the direction to the runway centerline as an arrow telling the pilot which direction to turn.', 'The indicator also included two neon lamps to indicate when the aircraft crossed over each of the marker beacons.', 'Later derivatives of the system had signals of equal length in the pattern left-right-silence, to operate a visual indicator in the cabin.', 'The Lorenz system was similar to the Diamond-Dunmore equi-signal radio guidance system, developed by the US Bureau of Standards in the early 1930s.', ',2,Use for blind bombing.', ""In the Second World War the Lorenz beam principle was used by the German Luftwaffe as the basis of a number of blind bombing aids, notably Knickebein ('crooked leg') and the X-Gerät ('X-Apparatus'), in their bombing offensive against English cities during the winter of 1940/41."", 'Knickebein was very similar to LFF, modifying it only slightly to be more highly directional and work over much longer distance.', 'Using the same frequencies allowed their bombers to use the already-installed LFF receivers, although a second receiver was needed in order to pinpoint a single location.', 'The X-Gerät involved cross-beams of the same characteristics but on different frequencies, which would both enable the pilot to calculate his speed (from the time between crossing the Fore Cross Signal and crossing the Main Cross Signal), and indicate when he should drop his payload.', 'The calculation was performed by a mechanical computer.', 'Lorenz modified this system to create the Viktoria/Hawaii lateral guidance system for the V-2 rocket.', ',2,Allied jamming effort.', ""When the British discovered the existence

a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man.', ',2,Plot summary.', 'The story takes place in a (then-future) fictional 1998, and centers on Anarch Peak, a black religious leader who had died in 1971 and is expected to rise soon.', ""Sebastian Hermes, an owner of a small Vitarium (a business that digs up the dead and gives them the treatment they need before returning them to

contemporary controversies about brain death, it seems not to be judged morally significant if a heartbeat can be heard, but it is illegal to dig anyone up before they start talking, which suggests resumed brain function is a marker of ""old-birth."")', ""Various groups are interested in controlling the affairs of the 'old-born', such as the Vitaria (technically, a person resurrected is in the

highest authority in Caucasian matters, as well as the owner of numerous religious artifacts and other items, like a syringe that can stop the Hobart Phase for short periods of time)."", 'These factions then argue over the ownership of Anarch Peak after his resurrection.', 'When the Library kidnaps Anarch Peak, both factions send Sebastian Hermes to recover him.', ""In the end Peak is killed and there may be an interracial war as a consequence of Peak's permanent death."", ',3,The Hobart Phase.', 'The Hobart Phase is the new order of life where people rise from the dead and are

eat, but instead consume ""Sogum"" anally through a pipe, and later ""plop"" out food orally, which is done in private, due to its \'shameful\' nature.', 'As for smoking, cigarettes are no longer smoked, but the smoke instead blown back into them, making them grow back to normal size (this also clears and freshens the air).', '""Goodbye"" and ""hello"" have reversed their order within standard greetings, and ""food"" is used as a drop-in replacement for the expletive ""shit"".', 'It is stated that Mars colonists do not have the Hobart Phase on their world, and it is limited to Earth, and presumably its lunar colonies as well.', ',3,Divided USA.', 'As hinted in the book, the United States of America has been partitioned into eastern and western segments.', 'Hawaii and Alaska have also

16,16,"[',1,preface.', 'WTTE, channel 28, is a Fox-affiliated television station located in Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""WTTE's broadcast license is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, while the station's operations are controlled via local marketing agreement (LMA) by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, WTTE's original owners and present proprietors of ABC affiliate WSYX (channel 6)."", 'Sinclar Broadcast Group also operates Chillicothe-licensed, CW-affiliated WWHO (channel 53), through a shared services agreement with Manhan Media.', ""The three stations share studios on Dublin Road in Grandview Heights, a suburb of Columbus; WTTE and WSYX also share a transmitter on Columbus' west side."", ',2,History.', 'WTTE began operations on June 1, 1984 as the first general-entertainment independent station in central Ohio.', 'The station was founded by the Commercial Radio Institute, a subsidiary of the Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group.', 'WTTE quickly became the dominant independent station in the area largely because its programming policy was far less conservative than that of the other independent in the area, Christian-oriented, Newark-licensed WSFJ-TV (channel 51).', 'Channel 28 is a charter affiliate of Fox, having joined the network at its launch on October 9, 1986.', 'From 1995 until 1997, it carried a secondary affiliation with UPN which was then picked up by WWHO.', 'In 1996, Sinclair merged with River City Broadcasting, owner of WSYX.', 'Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules at the time did not allow one person to own two stations in a single market.', 'Sinclair kept the longer-established WSYX and nominally sold WTTE to Glencairn, Ltd. owned by former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards.', ""However, nearly all of Glencairn's stock was held by the Smith family, founders and owners of Sinclair."", 'In effect, Sinclair still owned WTTE, and now had a duopoly in Columbus in violation of FCC rules.', ""Sinclair and Glencairn further circumvented the rules by moving WTTE's operations into WSYX' studios under a local marketing agreement, with WSYX as senior partner."", 'Glencairn owned ten other stations—all in markets where Sinclair also had a station.', 'Sinclair was eventually fined $40,000 for its illegal control of Glencairn.', 'The two companies attempted to merge in 2001 after the FCC allowed duopolies.', 'However, the FCC would not allow Sinclair to repurchase WTTE.', 'The FCC does not allow duopolies between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market.', 'Also the Columbus market, despite its relatively large size, has only seven full-power stations—too few to legally permit a duopoly.', 'WTTE thus remained under the banner of Glencairn, which was then renamed Cunningham Broadcasting.', ""However, the Smith family still controls nearly all of Cunningham's stock, so Sinclair still effectively has a duopoly in Columbus."", 'By nearly all accounts, Sinclair has used Glencairn / Cunningham as a shell corporation to evade FCC ownership rules.', 'In 2006, all Sinclair-controlled Fox affiliates including WTTE extended their affiliation contracts until at least March 2012.', 'WTTE-DT2 was formerly an affiliate of The Tube, a 24-hour digital music channel.', 'Like other Sinclair-owned stations, this was dropped in January 2007, due to a disagreement between Sinclair and The Tube over E/I programming.', 'The network ceased operations that October due to the lack of advertising.', 'According to Nielsen Media Research in the May 2011 ratings period, WTTE was the 2nd most watched Fox affiliate in the United States in prime time.', ""The station remains intensely competitive in the Columbus television market with it remaining an extremely strong competitor against WBNS-TV and WCMH-TV averaging roughly 300,000 viewers each night during the station's 10 o'clock newscast despite its earlier time slot."", 'WTTE typically wins the demographic viewership battle each and every ratings period.', 'The demographic win is a much sought after attribute for television sales associates in the area for local advertising purposes.', 'On October 18, 2010, the station reactivated their 28.2 digital subchannel for the first time since December 2006, with theCoolTV, a music video network which, unlike The Tube, had E/I programming pre-inserted as part of their national schedule.', 'The network was discontinued as of August 31, 2012.', ""WTTE is also considered an alternate ABC affiliate airing that network's programs when WSYX is unable to do so such as during a breaking news emergency or local special."", ""On May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network's affiliation agreement with the 19 Fox stations owned or controlled by Sinclair, including WTTE, allowing them to continue carrying the network's programming through 2017."", 'On June 23, 2014, Sinclair signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to carry the GetTV network as a subchannel on 33 of their stations; WTTE was one such station, and the 28.2 subchannel was reactivated.', ""On June 1, 2017, Sinclair replaced GetTV with TBD (TV network) on WTTE's 28.2 subchannel."", 'TBD is operated by Sinclair Television Group, a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group.', ',2,Digital television.', ',3,Analog-to-digital conversion.', 'WTTE was one of only two full-power television stations in the Columbus market (the other being WWHO) that honored the original DTV transition date of February 17, 2009.', 'The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28, at 11:59\xa0p.m. on that date, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.', ""The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using PSIP to display WTTE's virtual channel as 28 on digital television receivers."", 'However, until March 3, as part of the SAFER Act, analog channel 28 aired a repeating loop of a short informational film (in both English and Spanish) about the DTV changeover and how to upgrade to digital television.', 'Analog channel 28 has since gone dark.']","[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

17,17,"[',1,preface.', 'The Victorian Goldfields Railway is a broad gauge tourist railway in Victoria, Australia.', 'It operates along a formerly disused branch line between the towns of Maldon and Castlemaine.', ',2,History.', 'The original line was opened on 16 June 1884, opening up rail access from the established station at Castlemaine to the towns of Muckleford and Maldon.', 'The area was prosperous, as Castlemaine and Maldon had both experienced gold rushes in the preceding years, and local residents had been petitioning the state government for a railway since 1874.', 'On 2 August 1884, a contract was let for an extension to Laanecoorie, however further construction was suspended after the line reached the small town of Shelbourne in 1891.', 'The line was served by twice-daily trains for the first forty years of its life, which was increased to four-times-daily trains in 1924.', 'However, these were cut back at the end of the 1920s due to a decrease in the local population, and passenger services were eliminated altogether during World War II.', 'This meant that the line was only used by a weekly goods train which went through to Shelbourne.', 'When bushfire damage caused the closure of the Shelbourne extension in 1970, the remainder of the line was rendered largely useless, and it was officially closed in December 1976.', 'The response to the closure from the local community was swift, and the Castlemaine and Maldon Railway Preservation Society was founded in the same month, with the intention of reopening the line as a tourist railway.', 'While Maldon station was intact, and was able to be used as a base for their operations, they were faced with numerous problems: a line that needed substantial repairs, a lack of rolling stock, and rebuilding the demolished station at Muckleford.', ',2,Reconstruction.', 'Over the next decade, volunteers obtained and renovated rolling stock and by 1986, trains were able to operate on a one kilometre section of track out of Maldon.', 'By 1996, the line from Muckleford to Maldon had been restored, with the platforms being reinstated and a small replacement building being constructed.', 'Services were able to operate along a regular timetable, and the society set about reopening the Muckleford-Castlemaine section of the line.', 'The project received the support of the local, state and federal governments.', 'The necessary physical work had largely been completed by 2003, but it took another year to secure the necessary approvals and sign an agreement with freight operator Pacific National over the use of its line into Castlemaine station, which is still in regular passenger use today.', 'The section of line finally opened on 19 December 2004, approximately a year behind schedule.', ', the Society has shown no plans to restore the dismantled Shelbourne extension in the foreseeable future.', ',2,Current operations.', 'The railway now operates two return trips to Castlemaine on Sundays, Wednesdays & public holidays.', 'Steam locomotives operate most services, although the Society also operates diesels during days of total fire ban or when steam is not available.', ',2,Rolling stock.', ',3,VGR Locomotives & Railmotors.', ""Since October 2011, Steamrail Victoria have leased members of their fleet to the VGR in order to lighten the load on the railway's own

was built around the original foundation.', 'The south polygonal chevet of aisles were built as the first ones.', 'This was followed by the south enclosure wall construction, the south portal and the west wall where first two levels of both towers were composed to floor plan of church.', 'An advanced construction margin related to Silesian Gothic, which took part in the Franciscan church

old stone parts for the new ones.', 'Re-Gothic (re-gothisation) of towers was not realized due to lack of money.', 'This was reflected in a cheaper construction material.', 'During the Exchange of a base system in 1878–1882 cheap but low-quality sandstone from the nearby stone-pit Spiššké Vlachy was used.', 'Its quick dilapidated outer surface resulted in removal of pinnacles and gargoyles because they endangered pedestrians.', 'With the next reconstruction after 1882 good quality sandstone from Banská Bystrica was used.', 'The main Master builder of the major reconstruction in 1877–1880 was Josepf Weber.', 'In 1880–1896 Friedrich Wilhelm Fröde from Wien was the main master builder.', 'Supervision was done by Austrian architect Friedrich von Schmidt.', ""After that a famous

of an idea are four subordinate spaces, inset into the ground plan of the building and inserted between the arms of main and cross aisle.', 'In the first decades probably the enclosure walls were built and the main outline of space disposition was finished.', 'In the next few years the question of portals and arches construction should have been solved.', 'In the original spirit of the architecture the excellent stone sculpture works between 1420–1440 enriched construction structure with three big portals.', 'The north, the south, and west portals in Košice have difficult profiles,

became the basis for a lucrative software licensing business, being ported to the majority of the numerous home and other personal computers of the 1970s and especially the 1980s, and extended along the way.', 'Contrary to the original Altair BASIC, most home computer BASICs are resident in ROM, and thus are available on the machines at power-on in the form of the characteristic ""***codice***"" prompt.', ""Hence, Microsoft's and other variants of BASIC constitute a significant and visible part of the user interface of many home computers' rudimentary operating systems."", 'By 1981 Microsoft BASIC was so popular that even companies that already had a BASIC licensed the language, such as IBM for its Personal Computer.', 'IBM\'s Don Estridge said, ""Microsoft BASIC had hundreds of thousands of users around the world.', 'How are you going to argue with that?""', 'Microsoft licensed similar versions to companies that competed with each other.', 'After licensing BASICA to IBM, for example, Microsoft licensed the compatible GW-BASIC to makers of PC clones, and also sold copies to retail customers.', 'The company similarly licensed an Applesoft-compatible BASIC to VTech for its Laser 128

of BASIC used on Texas Instruments' TI-99/4A computer line."", 'Notably, it is not written in assembly language, but in a high level interpreter developed by TI.', ""The reason for this was because Microsoft did not have any programmers who knew how to code for the TI-99/4A's 9900 CPU and so Texas Instruments instead gave them an interpreter to code in instead."", 'The unfortunate effect of this was to make TI BASIC extremely slow due to being double-interpreted.', 'In addition to the version included in the ROM of the TI-99/4A, Texas Instruments also developed Extended Disk BASIC for disk drive owners.', ',3,6502 BASIC.', 'Microsoft developed a ROM-based BASIC implementation for the MOS 6502 microprocessor in 1976, which began appearing in microcomputers starting with the OSI Model 500

BASIC-80, for example there were no standard commands to clear the screen, output to a printer, or manipulate disk files and these were entirely up to the OEM to add themselves.', 'There is also no statement in 6502 BASIC to reseed the random number generator and the screen editor was also not standardized and varied widely with each implementation.', ',3,BASIC-68 and BASIC-69.', ""Microsoft

those years some Protestant theologians such as Bucer and Capito publicly expressed they thought he should be persecuted.', 'The trial against Servetus, an Antitrinitarian, in Geneva was not a case of church discipline but a criminal procedure based on the legal code of the Holy Roman Empire.', 'Denying the Trinity doctrine was long considered to be the same as atheism in all churches.', 'The Anabaptists made a considerable contribution to the development of tolerance in the early-modern era by incessantly demanding freedom of conscience and standing up for it with their patient suffering.', ',3,Castellio.', 'Sebastian Castellio (1515–1563) was a French Protestant theologian who in 1554 published under a pseudonym the pamphlet ""Whether heretics should be persecuted (De haereticis, an sint persequendi)"" criticizing John Calvin\'s execution of Michael Servetus: ""When Servetus fought with reasons and writings, he should have been repulsed by reasons and writings.""', 'Castellio concluded: ""We can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance.', 'Even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time, we can at any rate come to general understandings, can love one another, and can enter the bonds of peace, pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith.""', 'Castellio is remembered for the often quoted statement, ""To kill a man is not to protect a doctrine, but it is to kill a man.', ',3,Bodin.', 'Jean Bodin (1530–1596) was a French Catholic jurist and political philosopher.', 'His Latin work ""Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis"" (""The Colloqium of the Seven"") portrays a conversation about the nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds: a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic.', 'All agree to live in mutual respect and tolerance.', ',3,Montaigne.', 'Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), French Catholic essayist and statesman, moderated between the Catholic and Protestant sides in the Wars of Religion.', ""Montaigne's theory of skepticism led to the conclusion that we cannot precipitously decide the error of other's views."", 'Montaigne wrote in his famous ""Essais"": ""It is putting a very high value on one\'s conjectures, to have a man roasted alive because of them...To kill people, there must be sharp and brilliant clarity.""', ',3,The Warsaw Confederation.', 'The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth has a long tradition of religious freedom.', 'The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation.', 'the Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.', 'The Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was a private compact signed by representatives of all the major religions in Polish and Lithuanian society, in which they pledged each other mutual support and tolerance.', 'The confederation was incorporated into the Henrican articles, which constituted a virtual Polish–Lithuanian constitution.', ',3,Edict of Nantes.', 'The Edict of Nantes, issued on April 13, 1598, by Henry IV of France, granted Protestants—notably Calvinist Huguenots—substantial rights in a nation where Catholicism was the state religion.', 'The main concern was civil unity; The Edict separated civil law from religious rights, treated non-Catholics as more than mere schismatics and heretics for the first time, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance.', 'In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king.', 'The edict marked the end of the religious wars in France that tore apart the population during the second half of the 16th century.', 'The Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685 by King Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau, leading to renewed persecution of Protestants in France.', 'Although strict enforcement of the revocation was relaxed during the reign of Louis XV, it was not until 102 years later, in 1787, when Louis XVI signed the Edict of Versailles—known as the Edict of Tolerance—that civil status and rights to form congregations by Protestants were restored.', ',2,In the Enlightenment.', 'Beginning in the Enlightenment commencing in the 1600s, politicians and commentators began formulating theories of religious toleration and basing legal codes on the concept.', 'A distinction began to develop between ""civil tolerance"", concerned with ""the policy of the state towards religious dissent""., and ""ecclesiastical tolerance"", concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.', ',3,Milton.', 'John Milton (1608–1674), English Protestant poet and essayist, called in the ""Areopagitica"" for ""the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties"" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Moslems or even Catholics).', '""Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration.', 'Rather than force a man\'s conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel.""', ',3,In the American colonies.', 'In 1636, Roger Williams and companions at the foundation of Rhode Island entered into a compact binding themselves ""to be obedient to the majority only in civil things"".', 'Williams spoke of ""democracie or popular government.""', 'Lucian Johnston writes, ""Williams\' intention was to grant an infinitely greater religious liberty than then existed anywhere in the world outside of the Colony of Maryland.""', 'In 1663, Charles II granted the colony a charter guaranteeing complete religious toleration.', 'Also in 1636, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker and a group of companions founded Connecticut.', 'They combined the democratic form of government that had been developed by the Separatist Congregationalists in Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers) with unlimited freedom of conscience.', 'Like Martin Luther, Hooker argued that as faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit it could not be forced on a person.', 'In 1649 Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians only (excluding Nontrinitarian faiths).', 'Passed on September 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies.', 'The Calvert family sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and some of the other denominations that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of England and her colonies.', 'In 1657, New Amsterdam, governed by Dutch Calvinists, granted religious toleration to Jews.', 'They had fled from Portuguese persecution in Brazil.', ',3,Spinoza.', 'Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) was a Dutch Jewish philosopher.', 'He published the Theological-Political Treatise anonymously in 1670, arguing (according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) that ""the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted without injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that the peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the suppression of this freedom"", and defending, ""as a political ideal, the tolerant, secular, and democratic polity"".', 'After interpreting certain Biblical texts, Spinoza opted for tolerance and freedom of thought in his conclusion that ""every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction.""', ',3,Locke.', 'English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) published A Letter Concerning Toleration in 1689.', ""Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer."", 'Unlike Thomas Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argued that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest.', ""In his opinion, civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation."", 'However, Locke denies religious tolerance for Catholics, for political reasons, and also for atheists because ""Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist"".', 'A passage Locke later added to the Essay concerning Human Understanding, questioned whether atheism was necessarily inimical to political obedience.', ',3,Bayle.', 'Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) was a French Protestant scholar and philosopher who went into exile in Holland.', 'In his ""Dictionnaire historique and critique"" and ""Commentaire Philosophique"" he advanced arguments for religious toleration (though, like some others of his time, he was not anxious to extend the same protection to Catholics he would to differing Protestant sects).', 'Among his arguments were that every church believes it is the right one so ""a heretical church would be in a position to persecute the true church"".', 'Bayle wrote that ""the erroneous conscience procures for error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience procures for truth.""', 'Bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: ""One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel.""', 'He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state, but to the contrary: ""If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution.', 'In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it.""', ',3,Act of Toleration.', 'The Act of Toleration, adopted by the British Parliament in 1689, allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation.', 'The Nonconformists were Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists.', 'They were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.', 'The Act did not apply to Catholics and non-trinitarians and continued the existing social and political disabilities for Dissenters, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities.', ',3,Voltaire.', 'François-Marie Arouet, the French writer, historian and philosopher known as Voltaire (1694–1778) published his ""Treatise on Toleration"" in 1763.', 'In it he attacked religious views, but also said, ""It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other.', 'I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers.', 'The Turk my brother?', 'The Chinaman my brother?', 'The Jew?', 'The Siam?', 'Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?""', 'On the other hand, Voltaire in his writings on religion was spiteful and intolerant of the practice of the Christian religion, and Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin has claimed that the most significant of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire.', ',3,Lessing.', 'Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729–1781), German dramatist and philosopher, trusted in a ""Christianity of Reason"", in which human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by divine revelation.', 'His plays about Jewish characters and themes, such as ""Die Juden"" and ""Nathan der Weise"", ""have usually been considered impressive pleas for social and religious toleration"".', 'The latter work contains the famous parable of the three rings, in which three sons

should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society.', 'He links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society, in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will, over time, acquire the tolerance of the wider society.', ',3,Other criticisms and issues.', 'Toleration has been described as undermining itself via moral relativism: ""either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it.', 'If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good.""', 'Ronald Dworkin argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an

a movie, and it's too long by maybe half an hour."", 'It also suffers from the problem that the audience has everything figured out several minutes before Jack Lemmon does.', 'Still, the movie has a certain charm, some of which seeps in along with the locations, and there is in most of the many Wilder/Lemmon collaborations a cheerful insouciance, as if life is best approached with a cheerful, if puzzled, grin.""', 'Jay Cocks of ""Time"" observed, ""The topical dialogue by Wilder and I.A.L.', 'Diamond — Kissinger jokes, Billy Graham jokes, etc.', '— gives this passingly pleasant movie the sound of a Bob Hope TV special.', 'But Miss Mills is fresh and winning, and there is a deft performance by Clive Revill.""', 'The British television network Channel 4 has called the film ""a rare

value, it's simply a travel comedy about funny foreigners and love in the Mediterranean."", 'Yet what stands out is how uncomfortable Wilder seems to be with making a sex comedy in the 1970s.', ""Forced to take on board the aftershocks of the summer of love but saddled with an old man's attitude and an old man's cast, Wilder seems perilously out of his depth."", 'As Lemmon and Mills strip

the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Taarabt was among a group of players not given a squad number by then manager Juande Ramos, and also banned from the first-team training ground.', 'He was given his old number when Harry Redknapp took over team management, but his only league appearance that season came in a goalless North London derby on 8 February 2009, playing three minutes in place of Aaron Lennon.', ',3,Queens Park Rangers.', 'On 13 March 2009, he joined Championship team Queens Park Rangers on loan until the end of the season.', 'He scored his first goal for QPR in a 2–1 win over Bristol City.', 'His loan spell was cut short after he suffered a knee injury which required surgery.', 'Taarabt rejoined QPR on a season-long loan for the 2009–10 season on 23 July 2009.', 'On 1 October, Taarabt scored a ""wonder strike"" in a match against Preston North End.', 'He collected the ball on his chest inside the QPR half, dribbled 20 yards past three players and curled in a shot from 25 yards.', 'This led Jim Magilton to label Taarabt as a ""genius"" and the goal is seen as one of the Championship\'s finest.', 'Tottenham confirmed in October 2009 that Taarabt could stay at QPR for the season providing that a Premier League club did not make a bid for him in the January transfer window.', 'QPR were unable to make the transfer a permanent one because they could not afford the £4.5\xa0million valuation placed on Taarabt by Spurs.', 'In March 2010, Taarabt was quoted in an interview as being sorry that he signed for Tottenham.', 'He had said ""The big mistake was to sign for Tottenham and not go to another club when I first came over"".', 'He stated that he wished he had signed for Arsenal instead but had opted for Spurs after Damien Comolli moved from being a scout at Arsenal to director of football at Spurs.', 'He stated that he felt he would have been given more chances to play at Arsenal and was advised at the time not to sign for Spurs by his friends Armand Traore and Abou Diaby, who play for Arsenal.', 'Taarabt went on to state his intention to sign for one of the top clubs in Spain ""I hope to be playing for one of the top four in Spain next season – Real Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia or Sevilla.', 'I have contact with good teams and I know that they want me.', 'Now I just have to hope they can agree a deal with Tottenham.""', 'On 5 August 2010, QPR signed Taarabt to a permanent deal for an undisclosed fee.', 'The Moroccan agreed a three-year deal with the central London club.', 'In January 2011, Taarabt was interviewed by the ""Evening Standard"", in which he stated: ""The man who took me to Tottenham was Damien Comolli.', 'He was at Arsenal then.', 'But, when I was going to go to Arsenal, he moved to Tottenham.', ""He told me: 'Come to Tottenham."", 'We want to do like they do at Arsenal and take the best young players in the world.', ""You're going to have a better chance there.'"", 'I believed him.', 'This was a mistake and I regret it.', ""Tottenham tried to do it like Arsenal but it's a different culture."", 'I would have had a better chance at Arsenal.', 'I would progress with Arsène Wenger.', 'He is a legend in France, one of the best managers in the world"".', ',4,2010–11 season.', 'Adel Taarabt was to make his debut as a full Queens Park Rangers player as the club signed the Moroccan for a reported £1,000,000.', 'The contract with Queens Park Rangers provides for Tottenham to receive 40% of future transfer profit, in addition to the payments already made.', 'This was proved to be one of the bargains of the season as Taarabt went on to score 19 goals in 44 league appearances that season for the West London club.', ""With his unpredictable skill and reputation for never giving the opposition defence an easy 90 minutes, Taarabt went on to win the Championship Player of The Year award and gained a place in the Championship's best XI (also featuring teammate Paddy Kenny)."", 'In March 2011, Taarabt missed two matches when he returned to France for family matters as one of his cousins had tragically been killed by Algerians.', 'In the international match Morocco vs Algeria he picked up a booking and was lucky not to be sent off.', 'In the return fixture Morocco manager Erik Gerets decided to drop Taarabt to the bench.', 'Taarabt decided to not turn up to the international fixture and vowed to never play for his country again.', 'However, several months later Taarabt wanted to play for Morocco again which Gerets reluctantly allowed but said that if Taarabt acted irrationally again he would not play for his country whilst he was in charge.', 'Some notable moments during the season were against Cardiff City (away, 2–2 draw) where Taarabt picked up a brace, scoring a wonder goal in the process.', 'During the home game against the same opposition, Taarabt scored the winner which took QPR back to the top of the Championship.', ',4,2011–12 season.', ""The 2011–12 season marked Taarabt's first real foray into the Premier League, for although having been featured in English football's highest tier as a Tottenham Hotspur player, he had never made a breakthrough into the Spurs first eleven."", 'The start of the season held much optimism for both QPR and Taarabt, yet this soon gave way to speculation that he would move away, and his name was associated with the likes of PSG and Napoli.', 'This was coupled with the arrival of Joey Barton in the August transfer window, who was immediately installed as captain at the expense of Taarabt.', 'These factors had the unfortunate effect of unsettling the player and he was unable to recreate his form from the previous season.', 'By early November he had taken over 20 shots and none of these had resulted in a goal.', 'Prior to this he had often let his temper get the better of him.', 'During the 6–0 loss away to Fulham on 2 October he was substituted at half time, which apparently led to an argument with manager Neil Warnock.', 'This attitude provoked criticism from his teammates, with Joey Barton being particularly vocal.', 'Taraabt was again substituted at half-time for a poor showing in the 3–1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and was subsequently left out of the side for the games against Manchester City and Stoke City.', 'During this period continued speculation linked him with PSG, and Warnock even admitted he would gladly accept an offer for Taraabt if the right offer came along.', 'Taraabt went on international duty and also had some minor injuries which also saw him left out of the side at this stage.', ""Warnock was highly critical of the player's agents during this period and laid much of the blame for him being unsettled at their feet."", 'He advised him to rethink the advice they had given him and stated ""They won\'t make him better and I think it is a shame.', 'Adel can always make money but he is better than that.', 'I will be sad if he ends up going to make some money because I think he has great ability.""', 'Still left out of the side throughout most of November, subsequent injuries to his teammates saw a recall, however, and he was commended for his performance in the 2–0 loss to Manchester United on 18 December.', 'He sustained this level of improved performance against Sunderland and Swansea City.', ""On 31 March, Taarabt scored the first goal in Queens Park Rangers's victory over Arsenal, and was also voted Man of the Match."", 'Taarabt followed up his goal against Arsenal by scoring a long-range free kick – the winning goal in a victory over his former club Tottenham on 21 April.', 'He was also shown his first red card in English football in the same game for a second bookable offence.', ',4,2012–13 season.', 'On 11 July 2012, Taarabt signed a new three-year contract with QPR, keeping him at the club until June 2016.', 'On 1 October 2012, Taarabt scored his first goal of the season against West Ham United with a dipping long-range shot after dribbling past two players.', 'He scored his second goal in three games with an emphatic volley away against West Bromwich Albion on 6 October, only five days later.', ""On 15 December, he scored both goals in QPR's first victory of the 2012–13 season, a 2–1 win over West London rivals, Fulham, the second with a mazy dribble ending with a finish on the outside of his foot."", 'Manager Harry Redknapp praised Taarabt by stating, ""It was one of the all-time great performances, I felt.""', 'Then on 2 January 2013 in QPR\'s second win of the season, a 1–0 away

Rossoneri's renewed ambition on the transfer market."", 'He scored his first goal for AC Milan 8 minutes into his debut against Napoli, having tackled the ball in his own half and dribbling halfway across the pitch to score from outside the box in a 3–1 loss to Napoli.', 'On 19 February, he made his debut in the Champions League in the first leg of the round of 16 in a 0–1 loss at the San Siro against Atlético Madrid.', ',3,Return to Queens Park Rangers.', 'In the 2014 summer season, Taarabt returned from his loan spells back to QPR, but after starting in the League Cup game against Burton on 27 August, only came on as a substitute in the away game against West Ham.', 'Responding to a journalist\'s question, 67-year-old QPR manager Harry Redknapp, stated after his team\'s home defeat against Liverpool, ""Taarabt is not injured.', ""He's not fit."", ""He's not fit to play football unfortunately."", 'He played in a reserve game the other day and I could have run about more than he did.', 'I can\'t pick him.""', 'Taarabt responded that the manager is ""making excuses because QPR are losing games,"" adding, ""maybe he expects me to make more tackles.', 'I am not this type of player.""', ',3,Benfica.', 'On 12 June 2015, Taarabt signed a five-year contract with Portuguese champions Benfica.', 'On 10 January 2017, Taarabt joined Italian club Genoa on a loan deal.',

36,36,"[',1,preface.', 'Photometry is the science of the measurement of light, in terms of its ""perceived"" brightness to the human eye.', 'It is distinct from radiometry, which is the science of measurement of radiant energy (including light) in terms of absolute power.', 'In modern photometry, the radiant power at each wavelength is weighted by a luminosity function that models human brightness sensitivity.', 'Typically, this weighting function is the photopic sensitivity function, although the scotopic function or other functions may also be applied in the same way.', ',2,Photometry and the eye.', 'The human eye is not equally sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light.', 'Photometry attempts to account for this by weighing the measured power at each wavelength with a factor that represents how sensitive the eye is at that wavelength.', ""The standardized model of the eye's response to light as a function of wavelength is given by the luminosity function."", 'The eye has different responses as a function of wavelength when it is adapted to light conditions (photopic vision) and dark conditions (scotopic vision).', ""Photometry is typically based on the eye's photopic response, and so photometric measurements may not accurately indicate the perceived brightness of sources in dim lighting conditions where colors are not discernible, such as under just moonlight or starlight."", ""Photopic vision is characteristic of the eye's response at luminance levels over three candela per square metre."", 'Scotopic vision occurs below 2\xa0×\xa010 cd/m.', 'Mesopic vision occurs between these limits and is not well characterised for spectral response.', ',2,Photometric quantities.', 'Measurement of the effects of electromagnetic radiation became a field of study as early as the end of 18th century.', 'Measurement techniques varied depending on the effects under study and gave rise to different nomenclature.', 'The total heating effect of infrared radiation as measured by thermometers led to development of radiometric units in terms of total energy and power.', ""Use of the human eye as a detector led to photometric units, weighted by the eye's response characteristic."", 'Study of the chemical effects of ultraviolet radiation led to characterization by the total dose or actinometric units expressed in photons per second.', 'Many different units of measure are used for photometric measurements.', ""People sometimes ask why there need to be so many different units, or ask for conversions between units that can't be converted (lumens and candelas, for example)."", 'We are familiar with the idea that the adjective ""heavy"" can refer to weight or density, which are fundamentally different things.', 'Similarly, the adjective ""bright"" can refer to a light source which delivers a high luminous flux (measured in lumens), or to a light source which concentrates the luminous flux it has into a very narrow beam (candelas), or to a light source that is seen against a dark background.', 'Because of the ways in which light propagates through three-dimensional space — spreading out, becoming concentrated, reflecting off shiny or matte surfaces — and because light consists of many different wavelengths, the number of fundamentally different kinds of light measurement that can be made is large, and so are the numbers of quantities and units that represent them.', 'For example, offices are typically ""brightly"" illuminated by an array of many recessed fluorescent lights for a combined high luminous flux.', 'A laser pointer has very low luminous flux (it could not illuminate a room) but is blindingly bright in one direction (high luminous intensity in that direction).', ',3,Photometric versus radiometric quantities.', 'There are two parallel systems of quantities known as photometric and radiometric quantities.', 'Every quantity in one system has an analogous quantity in the other system.', 'Some examples of parallel quantities include:', 'In photometric quantities every wavelength is weighted according to how sensitive the human eye is to it, while radiometric quantities use unweighted absolute power.', 'For example, the eye responds much more strongly to green light than to red, so a green source will have greater luminous flux than a red source with the same radiant flux would.', 'Radiant energy outside the visible spectrum does not contribute to photometric quantities at all, so for example a 1000 watt space heater may put out a great deal of radiant flux (1000 watts, in fact), but as a light source it puts out very few lumens (because most of the energy is in the infrared, leaving only a dim red glow in the visible).', ',3,Watts versus lumens.', 'Watts are units of radiant flux while lumens are units of luminous flux.', 'A comparison of the watt and the lumen illustrates the distinction between radiometric and photometric units.', 'The watt is a unit of power.', 'We are accustomed to thinking of light bulbs in terms of power in watts.', 'This power is not a measure of the amount of light output, but rather indicates how much energy the bulb will use.', 'Because incandescent bulbs sold for ""general service"" all have fairly similar characteristics (same spectral power distribution), power consumption provides a rough guide to the light output of incandescent bulbs.', 'Watts can also be a direct measure of output.', 'In a radiometric sense, an incandescent light bulb is about 80% efficient: 20% of the energy is lost (e.g.', 'by conduction through the lamp base).', 'The remainder is emitted as radiation, mostly in the infrared.', 'Thus, a 60 watt light bulb emits a total radiant flux of about 45 watts.', 'Incandescent bulbs are, in fact, sometimes used as heat sources (as in a chick incubator), but usually they are used for the purpose of providing light.', 'As such, they are very inefficient, because most of the radiant energy they emit is invisible infrared.', 'A compact fluorescent lamp can provide light comparable to a 60 watt incandescent while consuming as little as 15 watts of electricity.', 'The lumen is the photometric unit of light output.', 'Although most consumers still think of light in terms of power consumed by the bulb, in the U.S. it has been a trade requirement for several decades that light bulb packaging give the output in lumens.', 'The package of a 60 watt incandescent bulb indicates that it provides about 900 lumens, as does the package of the 15 watt compact fluorescent.', 'The lumen is defined as amount of light given into one steradian by a point source of one candela strength; while the candela, a base SI unit, is defined as the luminous intensity of a source of monochromatic radiation, of frequency 540 terahertz, and a radiant intensity of 1/683 watts per steradian.', '(540 THz corresponds to about 555 nanometres, the wavelength, in the green, to which the human eye is most sensitive.', 'The number 1/683 was chosen to make the candela about equal to the standard candle, the unit which it superseded).', 'Combining these definitions, we see that 1/683 watt of 555 nanometre green light provides one lumen.', 'The relation between watts and lumens is not just a simple scaling factor.', 'We know this already, because the 60 watt incandescent bulb and the 15 watt compact fluorescent can both provide 900 lumens.', 'The definition tells us that 1 watt of pure green 555\xa0nm light is ""worth"" 683 lumens.', 'It does not say anything about other wavelengths.', 'Because lumens are photometric units, their relationship to watts depends on the wavelength according to how visible the wavelength is.', 'Infrared and ultraviolet radiation, for example, are invisible and do not count.', 'One watt of infrared radiation (which is where most of the radiation from an incandescent bulb falls) is worth zero lumens.', 'Within the visible spectrum, wavelengths of light are weighted according to a function called the ""photopic spectral luminous efficiency.""', 'According to this function, 700\xa0nm red light is only about 0.4% as efficient as 555\xa0nm green light.', 'Thus, one watt of 700\xa0nm red light is ""worth"" only 2.7 lumens.', 'Because of the summation over the visual portion of the EM spectrum that is part of this weighting, the unit of ""lumen"" is color-blind: there is no way to tell what color a lumen will appear.', 'This is equivalent to evaluating groceries by number of bags: there is no information about the specific content, just a number that refers to the total weighted quantity.', ',2,Photometric measurement techniques.', 'Photometric measurement is based on photodetectors, devices (of several types) that produce an electric signal when exposed to light.', 'Simple applications of this technology include switching luminaires on and off based on ambient light conditions, and light meters, used to measure the total amount of light incident on a point.', 'More complex forms of photometric measurement are used frequently within the lighting industry.', 'Spherical photometers can be used to measure the directional luminous flux produced by lamps, and consist of a large-diameter globe with a lamp mounted at its center.', 'A photocell rotates about the lamp in three axes, measuring the output of the lamp from all sides.', 'Lamps and lighting fixtures are tested using goniophotometers and rotating mirror photometers, which keep the photocell stationary at a sufficient distance that the luminaire can be considered a point source.', 'Rotating mirror photometers use a motorized system of mirrors to reflect light emanating from the luminaire in all directions to the distant photocell; goniophotometers use a rotating 2-axis table to change the orientation of the luminaire with respect to the photocell.', 'In either case, luminous intensity is tabulated from this data and used in lighting design.']","[1, 1, 1, 1,

later settled in the 17th century by English colonists.', 'Given its rocky soil, which was not good for farming, and the high potential for water power, the Naugatuck Valley became an industrialized area in the 19th century.', 'It has been associated with the brass and copper industries.', ',2,Watershed and course.', 'After winding through rural forested areas, the two branches of the Naugatuck
