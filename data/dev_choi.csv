', 'The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . ', 'When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . ', 'Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . ', 'Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . ', 'The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . ', 'This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . ', 'For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components . ', 'Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available .

', 'The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . ', 'When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . ', 'Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . ', 'Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . ', 'The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . ', 'This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . ', 'For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components . ', 'Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available . ', 'Mars has been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .

', 'Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . ', 'It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . ', 'A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . ', 'The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . ', 'The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . ', 'Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . ', 'Introduction The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . ', 'The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . ', 'In free-burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Afj as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere . ', 'In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .

Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology . ', 'Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 . ', 'He was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and watchmaker , as he plied his trade . ', 'At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation , he went into business for himself in 1831 , making lathes and small tools .

', ""Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch'in Ch'in palace some ten years later ; ; yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 B.C. to A.D. 220 ) .

', 'Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . ', 'Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . ', 'The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . ', ""It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . "", ""When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age .

', 'The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . ', 'The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . ', 'These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . ', 'In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . ', 'A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio .

', 'The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . ', 'When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . ', 'Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . ', 'Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . ', 'The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . ', 'This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . ', 'For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components .

', 'When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . ', 'Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . ', 'Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . ', 'The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . ', 'This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . ', 'For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components . ', 'Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available . ', 'individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . ', 'The basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption . ', 'In earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival .

', 'Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . ', 'There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . ', 'The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . ', 'By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . ', 'There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . ', 'Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . ', 'these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development .

', 'This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . ', 'In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . ', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one . ', ""There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy 's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his . "", 'There is only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time .

', 'Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . ', 'That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . ', 'Milman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . ', ""Proceeding from Parry 's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling .

', 'In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . ', 'If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . ', 'It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . ', 'On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species . ', 'There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . ', 'This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . ', 'The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . ', '( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . ', ') These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . ', 'The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used .

', 'The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . ', 'Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . ', 'Further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . ', 'The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . ', 'Also , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . ', ""At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . "", 'If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Afj of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .

"", ""`` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . "", 'Patience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union . ', 'Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . ', 'Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . ', ""Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . "", ""The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan 's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . "", 'The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . ', 'In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . ', ""It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . "", 'Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . ', 'The company incurred some $ 10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . ', ""The company has billed the United States Government for $ 7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor 's business . "", 'Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . ', 'one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . ', ""Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky 's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . "", 'In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . ', 'Through long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . ', 'Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . ', 'The moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . ', ""Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris ' first monologue , for example . "", 'Even then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance . ', 'Aside from Boris himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture . ', 'Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities , defined with economical precision . ', 'Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action : Pimen , Varlaam , Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni .

', 'Current programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . ', 'Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . ', 'The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . ', 'The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . ', 'The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act .

', 'The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . ', 'Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . ', 'There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . ', 'The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . ', 'By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . ', 'There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . ', ""Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . "", ""`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . "", 'Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . ', ""`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . "", 'The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . ', 'There have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . ', ""`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . "", ""Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . "", ""There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid '' . "", 'Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . ', ""What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? "", 'What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? ', 'Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . ', ""A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian 's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world 's richest city . "", ""Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers .

', ""Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . "", ""He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' .

', 'Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez .

', 'reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . ', 'And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . ', 'One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs .

', ""Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry-limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . "", 'The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . ', ""In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public-limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation .

46,46,"[""Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . "", ""`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . "", 'Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . ', ""`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . "", 'The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . ', 'There have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . ', ""`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . "", 'A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . ', 'But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . ', 'The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . ', 'By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . ', 'This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . ', ""Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . "", ""The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . "", 'emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . ', 'In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . ', 'Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . ', 'Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . ', 'A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . ', 'It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . ', ""In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . "", 'But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . ', ""City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . "", ""Estimates of the city 's loss in the $ 344,000 job have ranged as high as $ 200,000 . "", ""Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . "", ""The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . "", ""The Controller 's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172,400 performance bond covering the contract . "", 'The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . ', 'Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . ', ""Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . "", ""Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . "", 'It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . ', 'Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . ', 'Additional records of slow growth have been omitted . ', 'It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . ', ""Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . "", 'Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . ', 'R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . ', 'The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . ', ""It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs . "", 'Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired .

', 'the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . ', 'For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .

', 'A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . ', 'In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . ', ""Campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . "", 'The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . ', 'In general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . ', 'An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . ', 'First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . ', 'Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . ', 'All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . ', 'The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting .

', 'However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . ', 'The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . ', 'An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . ', 'There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . ', 'For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . ', 'For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . ', 'The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 .

52,52,"[""Santa Barbara -- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . "", ""Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more '' . "", ""He urged support for President Kennedy 's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . "", ""' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . "", ""`` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . "", ""Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . "", ""Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . "", ""Danger cited He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . "", ""The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' . "", 'it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . ', 'The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . ', 'The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . ', 'Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . ', 'This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . ', 'A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces . ', 'The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out . ', 'Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests . ', 'The instrumental method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time . ', 'the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . ', 'For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . ', 'It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . ', 'Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . ', 'In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . ', 'Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . ', 'A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . ', 'The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $ 12.50 a share . ', 'it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible .

', 'The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . ', "": talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy 's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . "", ""High up on the President 's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . "", 'On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . ', ""Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . "", 'To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . ', 'East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . ', ""Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . "", 'East Providence now has no civil defense program . ', ""Mr. Hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . "", 'He is not interested in being named a full-time director . ', ""Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . "", 'He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $ 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . ', 'Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . ', ""Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy 's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy 's brother-in-law . "", ""Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital 's National Guard Armory . "", ""Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It 's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . "", ""I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! "", ""As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory 's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $ 10,000 each . "", ""The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles . "", ""Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . "", ""A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . "", 'Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . ', 'After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . ', ""Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . "", 'Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . ', "") And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today 's prices . "", 'However , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . ', 'An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . ', 'First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . ', 'Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . ', 'crucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . ', ""Mr. Kennedy replied : `` I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . "", 'The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . ', 'But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . ', 'He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U.S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . ', 'Last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . ', 'The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . ', ""The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President 's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader .

"", ""J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . "", 'In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . ', 'This essay seeks to make that exploration . ', 'Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . ', ""He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . "", 'It is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . ', 'In Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession . ', 'Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his forefinger , a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates , half terrifies all who have dealings with him . ', ""Miss Havisham 's withered hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick .

"", 'The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . ', 'But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . ', 'He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U.S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . ', 'Last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . ', 'The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . ', ""The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President 's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader .

', 'Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets .

', 'The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children .

', 'The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees .

', 'For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components .

"", ""The John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city 's new and modern harbor . "", 'Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole . ', 'If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . ', 'Which was poison gas . ', 'It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront . ', 'For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons . ', 'Throughout the early years of World War 2 , , reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas -- Germany in Russia , Japan in China again . ', 'They were always denied . ', 'The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . ', 'The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . ', 'It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . ', 'Fire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . ', 'The sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . ', 'As new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it . ', 'B.J. Connell is the present treasurer and manager . ', ""The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way 's Lane . "", 'The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report . ', 'This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . ', 'For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . ', 'This could also be used for any other skin irritation . ', 'Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . ', ""`` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . "", 'The sufferer drinks tansy tea . ', 'Bruises , burns , cuts , etc. , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too . ', 'Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak . ', '( Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain . ', ') Salted butter was another cure for bruises . ', 'Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water ; ; the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts . ', 'Another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter . ', ""`` Butter salve '' or `` butter ointment '' was used for burns , and for bruises as well . "", 'This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ; ; when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled . ', ""Cow 's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly . "", 'The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters . ', 'Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking . ', 'To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment . ', ""For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series , under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger , Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James 's genius , not to mention the felicities of his style . "", 'And how he could write ! ! ', ""His famous criticism of brother Henry 's `` third style '' is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter 's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced . "", 'Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold . ', 'There was a fog , which increased the darkness of the night . ', 'Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow . ', 'He might have been anywhere or nowhere . ', 'The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi . ', 'Secretary of State Seward was a sick man . ', ""The idea had come from Herold , who had once been a chemist 's clerk . "", 'The sick were always receiving medicines . ', 'No one would question such an errand . ', 'The bottle was filled up with flour . ', ""Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward 's home , where Key had once been killed . "", 'Now it would have another death .

', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) .

', ""Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself .

', 'Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . ', 'Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . ', ""Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court .

', 'The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . ', 'The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . ', 'Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . ', 'This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . ', 'artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . ', 'To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . ', 'At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . ', 'Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life .

', 'These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . ', 'reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues .

"", 'Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , Bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , Bible-emancipated race .

', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one .

', ""It was not merely a hunger for `` money , gold and precious objects '' that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war to an end ; ; the pope was playing a dangerous game , with so many balls in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears , and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of European affairs . "", 'When the negotiations began , his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily in abeyance , and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who , under Charles of Valois , the papal vicar of Tuscany , were so valuable in the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies . ', ""If his circumspection in regard to Philip 's sensibilities went so far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of Amadee 's daughter , Agnes , to the son of the dauphin of Vienne -- a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas , for Savoy and Dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides -- for fear that he might seem to be favoring the anti-French coalition , he would certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return of Gascony to Edward , even though , as he admitted to the English ambassadors , he had been advised that the original cession was invalid . "", 'On the other hand , he did not want to offend Edward either , and he found himself in a very difficult position . ', 'On the surface , the whole question was purely feudal .

', ""While the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company 's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies . "", 'As a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . ', 'It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature . ', 'It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations . ', 'the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . ', ""Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . "", 'To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . ', 'In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . ', 'These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . ', 'The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . ', 'The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . ', 'It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . ', 'Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . ', 'Purification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . ', '( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . ', 'The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . ', 'The precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . ', '( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . ', '( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . ', 'Preparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . ', 'Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 \\*\\* ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees .

"", ""Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . "", 'With respect to this view , two points are worth making . ', ""First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . "", ""It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . "", ""It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn . "", 'More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . ', 'That a writer who is gay can not be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . ', ""Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . "", 'sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . ', 'The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . ', 'There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . ', ""Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley 's hymns are as follows . "", ""`` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . "", ""In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . "", 'Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last .

', 'artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . ', 'To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . ', 'At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . ', 'Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . ', 'And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . ', ""The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds . "", ""Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . "", ""J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . "", 'In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . ', 'This essay seeks to make that exploration . ', 'Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . ', ""He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . "", 'emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . ', 'In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . ', 'Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . ', 'Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . ', 'A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . ', 'It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . ', ""In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . "", 'But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex .

', ""These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini , who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in pencil , in Italian , that he `` began at this point '' . "", 'these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . ', 'For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . ', ""This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927 . "", 'One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . ', 'This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . ', 'In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . ', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one .

', 'Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . ', ""Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . "", 'With respect to this view , two points are worth making . ', ""First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . "", ""It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . "", ""It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn . "", 'More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . ', 'That a writer who is gay can not be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of .

', 'The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . ', 'The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . ', 'Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . ', 'This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . ', 'A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces . ', 'The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out . ', '70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale .

', 'The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 .

', 'The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . ', ""These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . "", 'Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . ', 'The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 . ', 'Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( ox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita ) ; ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) .

', 'The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . ', 'Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . ', 'There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . ', 'The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .

', 'The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . ', 'Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb .

', 'For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith .

"", 'One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . ', 'This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . ', 'In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . ', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one . ', ""There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy 's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his . "", 'There is only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time .

', ""If we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , is n't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ? "", ""I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst 's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life . "", 'A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man ; ; his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial . ', 'Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history . ', ""We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father 's woman . "", 'But a novel in which one man Karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly . ', 'It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex . ', 'Whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth , an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret .

', ""In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . "", ""This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . "", 'The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . ', 'Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . ', 'The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . ', ""There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance .

', 'Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . ', 'However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . ', 'A third aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election . ', 'The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections .

', 'They were stressed in the speeches of Si Mubarak Bekkai when the first Council of Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council .

"", ""Those writers known collectively as the `` Southern school '' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; ; according to many critics , in fact , the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War , both quantitatively and qualitatively . "", 'Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance . ', ""It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season 's cotton and tobacco crops ; ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century .
