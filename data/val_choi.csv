', 'There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . ', 'For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . ', 'For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . ', 'The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . ', 'The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . ', 'He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process . ', 'Moreover , by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages . ', 'Proceeding in this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number .

7,7,"['2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . ', 'In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . ', 'With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . ', 'Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . ', 'Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . ', 'If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . ', 'the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . ', 'Several factors contributed to this change . ', 'The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . ', 'Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . ', 'Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . ', 'International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . ', 'A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . ', 'But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . ', 'The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . ', 'By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . ', 'This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . ', ""Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . "", 'Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . ', 'Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . ', 'Impersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . ', 'Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . ', 'For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . ', 'Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . ', 'One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . ', 'A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . ', 'Afj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . ', 'The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . ', 'An isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . ', 'The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . ', 'The theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . ', 'The experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory .

"", ""`` Emory University 's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . "", 'But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . ', 'The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . ', ""`` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . "", 'The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . ', 'An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . ', ""The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' . "", ""Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . "", ""J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . "", 'In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . ', 'This essay seeks to make that exploration . ', 'Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . ', ""He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . "", 'Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . ', 'First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . ', 'In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . ', 'The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . ', 'Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . ', 'Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . ', 'Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . ', 'Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . ', 'Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . ', 'Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . ', 'Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . ', 'Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . ', 'it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . ', 'It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other .

"", ""The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women 's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men 's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . "", 'The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . ', 'The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . ', ""Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It 's unlike me '' . "", ""In private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E.E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles ' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . "", ""Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment 's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . "", ""Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she does n't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . "", ""It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . "", ""One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . "", 'The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . ', 'One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . ', ""Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? ? "", 'At first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . ', 'Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . ', ""At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! ! "", ""I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! !

', 'Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . ', ""Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court .

', 'Introduction Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . ', 'Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . ', 'The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . ', 'Report of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . ', 'A royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . ', 'Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . ', 'In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . ', 'But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . ', ""Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . "", 'With respect to this view , two points are worth making . ', ""First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . "", ""It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . "", ""It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn . "", 'More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . ', 'That a writer who is gay can not be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . ', ""Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . "", 'Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . ', 'But to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . ', 'invisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . ', ""`` Disaffiliation '' , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph : `` We disaffiliate .

"", 'If the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . ', 'Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art . ', 'Both of them were my friends . ', 'Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue . ', 'So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration .

', 'The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find . ', 'But it is a great conception . ', 'The open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers . ', 'The descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States . ', 'Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . ', 'After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career . ', 'A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . ', 'It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . ', 'There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . ', 'A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . ', 'In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . ', 'After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . ', 'By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . ', 'The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . ', ""In this test a Afj tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Afj with a clearance of 0.002 '' '' on each side of the tape .

"", 'it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies .

', 'Biological warfare Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . ', 'It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . ', 'Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals . ', 'Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . ', 'The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . ', 'The incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . ', 'A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases . ', 'Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities . ', 'An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area . ', 'An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . ', 'First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . ', 'Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . ', 'All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . ', 'The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting .

', 'It is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . ', 'We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose .

', 'There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . ', 'For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . ', 'For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter .

', 'In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . ', 'reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . ', 'And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . ', 'One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs .

"", 'With respect to this view , two points are worth making . ', ""First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . "", 'the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . ', ""Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . "", 'To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . ', 'In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . ', 'These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . ', 'The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . ', 'The injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . ', 'This resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . ', ""In any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . "", 'Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . ', 'the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . ', 'By and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . ', 'Moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . ', 'Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . ', 'During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . ', 'The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . ', ""Austin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . "", 'Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . ', 'Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . ', ""Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . "", ""That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . "", 'He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . ', 'Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . ', ""But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . "", 'A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . ', ""Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he did n't get into a single game . "", 'these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . ', 'For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . ', ""This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927 . "", 'briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . ', 'Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . ', 'And then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . ', ""The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . "", ""This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure . "", 'But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . ', 'Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . ', 'After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . ', 'Introduction Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . ', 'Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . ', 'The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . ', 'Report of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility .

', 'A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . ', 'But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . ', 'The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . ', 'By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . ', 'This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . ', ""Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . "", ""The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . "", 'The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . ', 'The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . ', 'The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . ', 'To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . ', 'Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . ', ""At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor 's reported plan was generally favorable . "", 'Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . ', ""The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor 's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .

14,14,"[""Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . "", ""J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . "", 'In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . ', 'This essay seeks to make that exploration . ', 'Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . ', ""He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . "", 'It is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . ', ""It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . "", ""One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . "", 'The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . ', 'One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . ', ""Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? ? "", 'At first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city .

Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . ', ""Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . "", 'To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . ', 'The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . ', 'The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable .

', 'Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program .

', 'Current programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . ', 'Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . ', 'The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . ', 'The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . ', 'The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . ', 'Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . ', 'The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools . ', 'The initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts . ', 'Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training . ', 'Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at least half . ', 'The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . ', 'Throughout the history of the program , state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments . ', 'these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . ', 'For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . ', ""This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927 . "", 'One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . ', 'This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . ', 'In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . ', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one . ', ""There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy 's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his . "", 'There is only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time . ', 'In the later poems , however , the personal tone predominates . ', 'The bad early poems are bad Shakespeare or bad Swinburne ; ; the bad late poems are bad Hardy . ', ""There are two ways of getting at a poet 's development : through his dated poems , and through the revisions which he made in later editions of his work . "", ""The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here '' ! ! "", 'So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York . ', 'In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school . ', 'Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good . ', 'When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities . ', 'Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands . ', 'These contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight . ', 'From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June . ', 'The Director , Walter E. Clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare . ', 'To him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind . ', 'Improved farming methods The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden . ', 'The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school . ', 'There had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and defacing of the bust of Lauro Di Bosis near the Villa Lante and in the Gianicolo . ', 'Something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it . ', 'The Italians felt it . ', 'Little things . ', 'An Italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of Quirinal Palace , the first time since the war . ', ""At least they had n't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated , flat , dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini 's home district -- Dogumenti , per favore . "", 'But , who knew , that might be coming one of these days . ', 'There were other Italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements , resisting . ', 'They laughed and , true to national form and manners , never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all , but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts . ', 'We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except Pavese , and Pavese is dead . ', ""Berto 's The Sky Is Red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book to come out of the war . "", 'Now he was married to a beautiful girl , had a small son , and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies .

', 'He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . ', 'From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . ', 'While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill .. Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . ', 'He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . ', 'They reside at 4911 Miles Dr .. Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . ', '2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . ', 'In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . ', 'With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . ', 'Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . ', 'Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . ', 'If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . ', 'An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . ', 'First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . ', 'Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . ', 'All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . ', 'The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . ', 'Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . ', 'Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . ', 'This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . ', ""In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . "", ""This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . "", 'The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . ', 'Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . ', 'The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . ', ""There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . "", 'the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . ', 'By and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . ', 'Moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . ', 'Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . ', 'During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . ', 'The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . ', 'Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer . ', '70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale . ', 'These were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals . ', 'Appeals were heard for two days two weeks ago . ', 'About 75 persons appeared at that time . ', 'Louis H. Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . ', 'They also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . ', ""Any adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town 's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . "", 'John Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday . ', 'sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . ', 'The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . ', 'There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . ', ""Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley 's hymns are as follows . "", ""`` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . "", ""In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . "", 'Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . ', 'But the parallel is significant . ', 'A royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . ', 'Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . ', 'In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . ', 'But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . ', 'A unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . ', 'The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . ', ""General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) .

"", ""`` He has married me with a ring of bright water '' , begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys . "", 'The place is Camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye . ', 'It is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , Greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters . ', 'How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience . ', 'Just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough . ', 'reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . ', 'And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . ', 'One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . ', 'Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . ', 'Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . ', ""The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . "", 'For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . ', 'By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . ', ""The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission . "", 'This broad delegation leaves within our discretion ( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided . ', '3 . ', 'The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc. to 1600 kc .. Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each interferes to some extent with reception of the other . ', 'The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day . ', 'Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others . ', 'With the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances . ', 'Rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station separations ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation . ', 'An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable . ', ""By this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A 's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B 's signal at that point . "", 'Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . ', 'This is particularly true in site selection .

', 'The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . ', 'Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . ', 'Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . ', 'International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . ', 'Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . ', 'In both respects , international law was Europeanized . ', 'It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . ', ""On the one hand , the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . "", 'But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world . ', 'The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . ', 'Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . ', 'Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . ', ""`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . "", 'And that is just what happened on the last few holes . ', 'The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . ', 'Player was the first to feel its teeth .

', 'The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . ', 'Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . ', 'However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . ', ""Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . "", ""J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . "", 'In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . ', 'This essay seeks to make that exploration . ', 'Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . ', ""He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .

', 'At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge .

', 'This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . ', 'The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . ', '( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages .

', ""Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . "", 'To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . ', 'In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . ', 'These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . ', 'The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . ', 'The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . ', 'It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . ', 'Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . ', 'It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . ', 'No single explanation is adequate to account for this .

', ""Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . "", 'The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . ', ""Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry-limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands .

51,51,"["": talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy 's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . "", ""High up on the President 's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . "", 'On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . ', ""Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . "", 'To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . ', 'The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . ', 'The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . ', ""Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . "", 'A royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . ', 'Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . ', 'In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . ', 'But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . ', 'A unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . ', 'The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . ', ""General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . "", 'briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . ', 'Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . ', 'And then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . ', ""The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . "", ""This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure . "", 'But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . ', 'Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . ', 'After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . ', 'Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . ', "") And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today 's prices . "", 'However , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . ', 'The new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . ', ""It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . "", ""As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . "", 'Subways improved land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . ', 'reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . ', 'And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . ', 'One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . ', 'Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . ', 'Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . ', ""The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . "", 'Sentiment . ', 'Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . ', 'One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . ', 'The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . ', 'The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . ', 'It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . ', 'The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . ', 'The newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship . ', 'Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . ', 'This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . ', ""In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems . "", ""This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . "", 'The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . ', 'Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . ', 'a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . ', 'Urethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . ', ""Yet last year 's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 . "", 'Many of the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential . ', 'And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated . ', 'As this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength ; ; another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated . ', 'On the following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing . ', 'the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard . ', 'What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? ? ', 'To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . ', 'It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . ', ""If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest . "", 'This is the course the positivists took . ', 'There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . ', 'Mollusks are a case in point . ', 'The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . ', 'Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . ', 'There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . ', 'The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . ', 'By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . ', 'There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture .

53,53,"[""London , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain 's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy 's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . "", 'The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . ', 'It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . ', ""It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy 's Nautilus , the world 's first atomic submarine . "", 'Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . ', 'Five held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . ', 'A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . ', 'They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . ', 'Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . ', 'When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . ', 'reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . ', 'And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . ', 'One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . ', 'Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . ', 'Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . ', ""The double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . "", 'For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . ', 'By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution .

"", ""He urged support for President Kennedy 's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . "", 'It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . ', 'No single explanation is adequate to account for this . ', 'Improvement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . ', 'The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . ', 'Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . ', 'An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . ', 'By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages . ', 'This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . ', 'Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . ', 'Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . ', 'The second need is better field techniques . ', 'A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . ', 'It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . ', 'There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . ', 'A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . ', 'In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . ', 'After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . ', 'By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . ', 'The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . ', ""In this test a Afj tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Afj with a clearance of 0.002 '' '' on each side of the tape . "", 'This gives a rate of shear of Afj . ', 'This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs . ', 'The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . ', 'On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . ', 'Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . ', ""Hotel Escape 's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . "", 'This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . ', 'Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . ', 'The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . ', 'In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . ', 'Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . ', 'Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . ', ""If they ca n't chalk up big business here then let 's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , elsewhere Andy Bartha and his trio have booked into Oceania Lounge .

', 'Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . ', 'Introduction The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . ', 'The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . ', 'In free-burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Afj as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere .

', 'If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . ', 'It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . ', 'On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Afj and then to Afj as the active iodinating species .

', 'The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . ', 'And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . ', 'There have been a number of sound plans proposed . ', 'But none of these has been implemented .

"", 'Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , Bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , Bible-emancipated race .

', 'Even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists as Kemble and Guest were led into what now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical philological development . ', ""It was therefore not until the publication of J.H. Round 's `` The Settlement Of The South And East Saxons '' , and W.H. Stevenson 's `` Dr. Guest And The English Conquest Of South Britain '' , that a scientific basis for place-name studies was established .

"", 'Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . ', 'Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition .

', ""Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm 's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . "", 'To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . ', 'In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . ', 'These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . ', 'The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . ', 'The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . ', 'It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . ', 'There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . ', 'This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . ', 'The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 .

', 'It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . ', 'A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . ', 'The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . ', 'The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . ', 'Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . ', 'Introduction The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . ', 'The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . ', 'In free-burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Afj as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere . ', 'In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .

64,64,"['Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . ', 'Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . ', ""Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . "", 'Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . ', 'A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . ', 'House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . ', ""Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . "", 'Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .

', 'These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface .

"", 'With respect to this view , two points are worth making . ', ""First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . "", ""It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . "", ""It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn . "", 'More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . ', 'That a writer who is gay can not be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . ', ""Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . "", 'Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . ', 'But to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . ', 'Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity .

"", 'The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . ', 'it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . ', 'The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . ', 'The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . ', 'Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness .

', 'Further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force .

', ""Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . "", 'The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . ', ""Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry-limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . "", 'The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . ', ""In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public-limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . "", 'For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . ', 'Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions . ', ""Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel 's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' . "", ""J.H. Miller 's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective .

', 'This essay seeks to make that exploration . ', 'Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . ', ""He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor 's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .

', 'the Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . ', 'The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . ', 'Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . ', 'Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds .

74,74,"[""A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque 's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago , the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 . "", ""If this was in fact Mr. Remarque 's intention he has achieved a notable failure . "", ""Clerfayt of `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas Portago was a good one . "", 'He is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; ; the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate . ', ""One looked forward to Mr. Remarque 's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised . "", ""Unhappily , `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list . "", ""Mr. Remarque 's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble . "", 'He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery . ', 'His treatment of it is something else . ', 'His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay . ', 'Her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen . ', ""They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury 's expense . "", 'They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports . ', 'Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman . ', 'The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available . ', 'First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters . ', ""The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department 's budget . "", 'Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department . ', 'Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ; the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury . ', 'A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . ', ""The congressman 's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department . "", 'Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write . ', 'With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly . ', 'No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger . ', 'In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson . ', 'the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . ', 'Several factors contributed to this change . ', 'The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . ', 'Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . ', 'Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . ', 'International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . ', 'Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . ', 'In both respects , international law was Europeanized . ', 'It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . ', ""On the one hand , the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . "", 'But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world . ', 'Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . ', ""Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself . "", 'A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality ; ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin American countries ; ; out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . ', 'This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century scholars . ', ""Local industry 's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960 's industrial development effort . "", 'Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $ 11,900,000 ; ; a new post-World War 2 , record . ', 'With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here . ', 'What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs . ', ""Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R/NP.I. Industrial Building Authority 's 100 % guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls . "", 'Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc . ', 'Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W.R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company . ', 'Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . ', 'Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . ', 'He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . ', ""The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . "", ""Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` Signal '' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` Journal '' . "", ""`` Signal '' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais . "", 'Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg . ', ""Program note reads as follows : `` Take hands ; ; this urgent visage beckons us '' . "", ""Here , as in `` Journal '' , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion 's share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements . "", ""Indeed , both `` Journal '' and `` Signal '' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics . "", 'But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing . ', 'One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development . ', 'It may be , of course , that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation . ', 'But it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time . ', 'One thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be . ', ""' an American journey ' A brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled `` An American Journey '' was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company . "", ""Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris ' `` Once Upon A Time '' as well as her `` Women 's Song '' and Mr. Nagrin 's `` Indeterminate Figure '' . "", ""Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` An American Journey '' , and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes . "", 'us see just how typical Krim is . ', 'He is New York-born and Jewish . ', 'He spent one year at the University of North Carolina because Thomas Wolfe went there . ', ""He returned to New York to work for The New Yorker , to edit a Western pulp , to `` duck the war in the OWI '' , to write publicity for Paramount Pictures and commentary for a newsreel , then he began his career as critic for various magazines . "", 'Now he has abandoned all that to be A Writer . ', 'I do not want to quibble about typicality ; ; in a certain sense , one manner of experience will be typical of any given group while another will not . ', ""But I 've got news for Krim : he 's not typical , he 's pretty special . "", ""His may typify a certain kind of postwar New York experience , but his experience is certainly not typical of his `` generation 's '' . "", 'She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name . ', ""She was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery 's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 . "", ""The John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city 's new and modern harbor . "", 'Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole . ', 'If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . ', 'Which was poison gas . ', 'It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront . ', 'A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise . ', 'This theory eventually proved inexact . ', 'But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science . ', 'It is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors . ', 'These keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge . ', 'In the autumn of 1959 , the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology . ', 'Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator . ', ""The participants were Professor H. Bondi , professor of mathematics at King 's College , London ; ; Dr. W.B. Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College , London ; ; Dr. R/NP.A. Lyttleton , a lecturer at St. John 's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; ; and Dr. G.J. Whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , London . "", 'Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator . ', ""The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` Rival Theories Of Cosmology '' . "", 'Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity . ', 'First of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds . ', 'The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement . ', 'In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves . ', ""The main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever .

"", 'Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . ', 'The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . ', 'The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . ', 'These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . ', 'In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . ', 'A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . ', 'Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . ', 'The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . ', 'In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products . ', 'Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates . ', 'These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 . ', 'The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . ', 'On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . ', 'Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . ', 'A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . ', 'In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . ', ""Campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . "", 'The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . ', 'In general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . ', 'There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy . ', 'If there were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes .

', 'This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .

', 'The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .

', 'For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream .

', 'The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . ', 'He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process . ', 'Moreover , by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages .

', 'Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties , which already had high school desegregation . ', 'The action was a result of a court order , the citation for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference . ', 'In Maryland the Harford County Board of Education had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which a plaintiff had challenged ; ; thus , county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation . ', 'a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Afj . ', 'These are real analytic periodic functions with period T . ', 'In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . ', 'This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Afj . ', 'The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . ', 'it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . ', 'The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . ', 'The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . ', 'Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . ', 'This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . ', 'A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces . ', 'The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out . ', 'Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests . ', 'The instrumental method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time . ', 'If a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating . ', 'At low thicknesses a cutting ( or shearing ) phenomenon is often encountered .

', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one .

', 'For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . ', ""This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927 . "", 'One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . ', 'This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . ', 'In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . ', ""Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . "", 'And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one .
